# 13 Object Relational Mapping (ORM): E-commerce Back End

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Steps

* created repository and cloned
* looked over exisiting code
* installed npm files mysql2, express, sequelize and dotenv
* created the .env file to hide user, password and db name from connections
* updated server.js file to connect to sequelize
* filled in all the models
* updated each route accordingly to find, create, update and destroy
* tested each option to make sure routes worked accordingly
